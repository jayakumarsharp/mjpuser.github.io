# Learn HTML
The very first thing to know about web development is HTML.  **HTML is the language used by your browser to render a website.**  Let's start off with an example.  Check out the code and it's rendered counterpart below:

#### HTML code

{% highlight html linenos %}
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Website</title>
    <meta name="author" content="Matthew Prestifilippo">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My Great Company</h1>
    <p>My company makes things</p>
  </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

#### HTML rendered
<pre><iframe style="border:none;" src="/demos/html/demo.html" ></iframe></pre>

You might be able to see that **My Great Company** and **My company makes things** is rendered, but **My Website** is not rendered.  This is because only things in between the `<body>...</body>` are rendered on the web page.  HTML that is inside of `<head>` is kind of like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letterhead" target="_blank">letterhead</a> in that it is used to tell you information about the page itself.  In this example, our `<head>` just let's us know the title of the page and the author.

HTML is made up of elements.  For example, `<h1>My Great Company</h1>` is an HTML element, and so is `<body>...</body>`.  The general form, or syntax, of an element is `<tagname>text</tagname>` where `tagname` is one of the defined elements.  There are more than 100 types of HTML elements, and you can <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/elements.html" target="_blank">click here to see a complete list of HTML tags</a>.  Every HTML page starts with the **html** element, and has a **head** and **body** element.

### Exercise 1: Try HTML
> In this exercise, you will be able to edit HTML and see how the HTML affects the rendering.

> * Go to the <a href="https://jsbin.com/diloki/edit?html,output" target="_blank">jsbin editor</a>

> * Edit the html to render two headings.  One that says: "Hello, World" and one that says "Hello, Venus".

> * Nest an `<h1>` element inside of a `<p>` element like this: `<p>beginning <h1>title</h1> ending</p>`.  What happens to the text?

## HTML Syntax and Structure

We know that HTML is made up of elements, but we need to get some general rules in order to understand how more complex websites are made.

### Nesting

Some elements are "inside" other elements.  Just as the `<title>` element is inside the `<head>` element.  This is called **nesting**.  Nested elements are called **child elements**, and naturally, the elements that are doing the nesting are called **parent elements**.  So in our example above, `<title>` and `<meta>` are the child elements of the parent element `<head>`, and `<head>` and `<body>` are the child elements of the parent element `<html>`.

All child elements must end before their parent ends.
> **Good**

> `<p>This is a <em>good</em> example</p>`

> **Bad**

> `<p>This is a <em>bad</p> example</em>`

> Notice how the `<p>` element ended before the `<em>` element.


The end result of all of this nesting creates a **tree structure**.
